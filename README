networks programming assignment 4

name: anthony cantor

USAGE:
> make start_coord
> make start_node

after everything builds, the quickest and easiest way to get up and running is to 
start the coordinator. for example:
./start_coord 1.10.11 1.2.7 2.3.4 3.5.6 5.10.2 10.9.6 10.7.12 9.7.13 9.6.7 6.7.15 6.4.9 4.8.7 8.2.1

(each argument is an edge in the graph NODE.NODE.COST)
the coordinator will start up and wait for nodes to register. next you can move to a different terminal,
possibly on a different elra and run

> screen
> bash screen_nodes.sh 10 54545 elra-04.cs.colorado.edu

this script will open 10 nodes (the above network needs ten nodes) in ten different screen windows. each 
node will connect to elra-04 on port 54545.

the nodes and coord will get setup and you can go back to the coord terminal and enter commands.

NOTES ON IMPLEMENTATION:
i implemented distance vector routing with split horizon (and poison reverse). however one thing i 
should point out is that i have each node prefer direct links if possible even if there is a
cheaper indirect route. i did this mostly to simplify my implementation and avoid loops.
